<body onload="console.log(document.lastChild)">

<!-- 

Note that any script can be added after/before the console.log as long as its separated with a ;

Also, document.lastChild is a DOM element, to convert that into a string you can use document.body.outerHTML and (why not)
feed it to its own innerHTML like so :

<body onload="document.body.innerText = document.body.outerHTML">
